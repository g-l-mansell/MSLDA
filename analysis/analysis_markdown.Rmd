```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Introduction
Remake MSLDA as a just a package with no analysis.
This script will then contain the analysis, so everything is in one place to be easily rerun.

Whether to rerun all the analysis or just load the results of the last runs will be controlled here:
```{r}
rerun_original <- T
rerun_reshaped <- T
rerun_smoothed <- T
```

# Edits to make
Within the LDA original script, add a catch of what to do when alpha goes below 0
OR remove alpha to be a hyperparameter so its more like the other two versions?

Try to implement one of the methods in Rcpp - including using RcppParallel?




# Text data
Run all 3 versions on the simulated dataset of documents

Check that all three have monotonically increasing likelihood

Check that all 3 find reasonable thetas and beta when K=3
